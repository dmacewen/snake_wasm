# Hackathon 2018 Project

Built in and runnable in [webassembly.studio](https://webassembly.studio/?f=xu5ktxlhehe)

## Todos/Bugs:
 * New fruit can spawn in snake, then get erased when snake's tail goes over it. Makes fruit disappear but it still needs to be eaten
 * Disable being able to turn snake directly into itself (180) and eating itself... Seems to fustrate people
 
## Enhancements:
 * Cant hit walls
 * Multisnake? (multiplayer... tron crossover style)
 * Fruit disappears after a certain amount of time
 * Snake speeds up?
